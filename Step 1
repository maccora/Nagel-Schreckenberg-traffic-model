# I made this program out of boredom and genuine curiosity during quarantine
# This program will attempt to implement the first step of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model for traffic
# The max velocity in this situation is +45 mph
# Step 1 states that if the velocity of any car is less than the max velocity, you increment its velocity by one
